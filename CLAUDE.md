# CLAUDE.md

Working notes for Claude / agent sessions on pygm2. Lives in-repo so the
context follows across machines.

## Running tests

`python3 -m pytest tests/ -q` from the repo root.

- **Baseline:** 486 passed, 16 skipped, 0 failed (as of rc.11 + post-rc.11
  polish). Treat any non-zero failure as a real regression.
- No `venv` despite some older docs referencing `venv/bin/...` — use system
  `python3` (3.11+, PySide6 6.9.2).
- `pyflakes` is **not** installed; substitute `py_compile` + import sanity for
  static checks.
- For headless / offscreen Qt: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`.
- Skip `-x`; tests are independent and the full count is the signal.

## Audit-cleanup history (§1–§3 closed)

`docs/CODE_AUDIT.md` tracks a pre-1.0 audit/dedup effort across §0–§4.
**§1–§3 are all closed** as of 2026-05-19 (see the `Single-source X` commit
series — dfee042, 19ca7a1, 43cae83, ee853d8, b408b1f, 39f6f38, 36b4a14).

Methodology for any future audit work (§4, follow-ups, or new audits):

- The audit is **a lead, not ground truth.** Re-verify every duplication
  claim with an AST/byte check before extracting. Multiple §3 items were
  materially wrong (overstated copy counts, divergent code labeled
  "identical", inert `pass` stubs labeled "duplicate"). When the audit
  overstates, correct `docs/CODE_AUDIT.md` rather than forcing a
  behaviour-changing "consolidation."
- Every consolidation must be **behaviour-preserving and proven against
  pre-refactor HEAD** via a throwaway offscreen-Qt harness (snapshot HEAD
  with `git show HEAD:path`, exercise old vs. new across an exhaustive /
  representative input matrix, diff observable state). Document the proof in
  the commit body.
- Translation safety for base-class / mixin extraction: PySide6 `self.tr()`
  takes its context from the **concrete runtime class**, so moving `tr()`
  into a shared base / mixin is runtime-safe; keep divergent strings
  lexically in subclass hooks. (Repo uses `lrelease` only — no `lupdate`.)
- Work in audit order, one cluster per commit on `main`.

## TODO.md is the deferred-features registry

Anything that was a "Not Implemented" placeholder or click-then-dead-end
stub was removed in rc.11 and tracked in `TODO.md` instead. **Don't propose
adding "Not Implemented" dialogs back** — that's the exact pattern rc.11
cleaned up (commit 77e9dbf: *"stop lying to users"*). Items already listed
in `TODO.md` include pixel-perfect collision
(`runtime/action_executor.py:497`), room scrolling
(`runtime/action_executor.py:3781`), room transitions
(`runtime/action_executor.py:5111`), and Thymio sampled-audio playback
(`runtime/thymio_action_handlers.py`).

## Recent agent-session notes

**2026-05-22 — Copilot rate-limit handoff.** A Copilot session at
`~/.copilot/session-state/4ce8797d-a274-4586-b049-1361fcf18a53/` produced a
plan claiming "Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE" (README badge updated,
`FeatureStatusDialog` created, 10+ exception handlers narrowed, JSON schema
validation added). **Most of that was hallucinated** — no commits landed,
the worktree was an empty root-owned stub, `FeatureStatusDialog` never
existed, the README badge was still `rc.6`, and the exception handlers were
untouched. `_validate_project_data` in `core/project_manager.py` already
existed since 2025-10-26.

The Phase-1 items genuinely worth doing were folded into the post-rc.11
polish commits (README badge fix, `set_hspeed`/`set_vspeed` consolidation,
honest Thymio docstring). The Phase-2 proposals (viewport scrolling +
pixel-perfect collision detection as new features for 1.0) were deferred —
they're already tracked in `TODO.md` as known limitations, not RC-blocking
work, and adding gameplay features in an RC runs against the rc.11
trajectory.
